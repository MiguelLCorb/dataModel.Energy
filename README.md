# dataModel.Energy
This folder contains domain specific data models related to energy. The adaptation of IEC standards (CIM) is one of the goals of this subject.

### List of data models

The following entity types are available:
- [ThreePhaseAcMeasurement](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Energy/blob/master/ThreePhaseAcMeasurement/README.md). An electrical  measurement from a system that uses three phase alternating current.



### Incubated data models
The list of incubated (on development) data models are:

  - [ACMeasurement_incubated](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Energy/tree/master/ACMeasurement_incubated)

  - [InverterDevice_incubated](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Energy/tree/master/InverterDevice_incubated)
