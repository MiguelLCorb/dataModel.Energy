    "description": "The Data Model intended to measure the electrical energies consumed by an electrical system which uses an Alternating Current (AC) for a three-phase (L1, L2, L3) or single-phase (L) and neutral (N). It integrates the initial version of the data Modem [THREEPHASEMEASUREMENT], extended to also perform single-phase measurements. It includes attributes for various electrical measurements such as power, frequency, current and voltage.",
